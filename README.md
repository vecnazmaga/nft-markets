# Reservoir Sample Marketplace

This repo is designed to help you quickly get started building on top of [Reservoir](https://reservoirprotocol.github.io/), a web3-native order book protocol.

## Modes

The marketplace supports 3 different modes:

- Single collection (e.g. [Crypto Coven](https://cryptocoven.reservoir.market))
- Multi collection community (e.g. [BAYC](https://bayc.reservoir.market))
- All collections ([example](https://www.reservoir.market))

A demo deployment allows you to test any collection, by changing the subdomain:

- [{collection-slug}.reservoir.market](https://cryptocoven.reservoir.market) (if a collection is unsupported, ping us on Discord to get it added)
- [{community-id}.reservoir.market](https://bayc.reservoir.market) (currently works with `bayc`,`loot`,`forgottenrunes`)

## Get started

Fork this repository and follow these instructions:

### Install dependencies

With yarn:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

With NPM:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Add environment variables

There are also two main environment variables used in this repo:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` is the Ethereum Chain ID. Use 1 for Ethereum Mainnet and 4 for Rinkeby Testnet.  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` is the base url for the Reservoir API. This will vary depending on the network you are using.

You can copy the values you want to use from `env.development` or `env.production` into a new file called `.env.local`

If you want to focus on a particular collection or community, add one of the following variables:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLECTION={collection-slug}`  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMUNITY={community-id}`

If you want to change the name and logo shown in the navigation bar:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_NAVBAR_TITLE={your-title}`

`NEXT_PUBLIC_NAVBAR_LOGO={url}`

The url for the logo can be a relative path if you have the image stored in your repository:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_NAVBAR_LOGO="/logo.png"`

If you want to support cross-posting listings to Open Sea (optional), you'll need an API key:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENSEA_API_KEY=abc`

### Run the app

Once you have your setup ready, run:

With yarn:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

With npm:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Then navigate to http://www.localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Deploy

This is a Next.js app that can be easily deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
